# What Is Final Cut Pro?

Final Cut Pro is a professional video editing app developed by Apple for macOS. It is used by YouTubers, filmmakers, marketers, and video editors worldwide.

Unlike many editors, Final Cut Pro uses a Magnetic Timeline, which keeps clips connected automatically. This helps avoid gaps and makes editing faster.

It supports 4K, 8K, HDR, motion graphics, color grading, and advanced audio tools. You can also expand it using plugins and templates.

Final Cut Pro is a one-time purchase, not a subscription. Once you buy it, you get lifetime updates.

It works best on MacBooks, iMacs, and Mac Studios with Apple Silicon chips.
